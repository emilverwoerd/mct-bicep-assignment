# Assigment 4

### Assignment
The fourth Assignment is to create a `main.bicep` file and create a module that calls the file `storage.bicep` The module allows to include multiple files and deploy multiple resources within one deployment run.

If you don't have any azure subscription make an ARM template through the Bicep tools it see what it looks like. Please note that the second deployment will go quicker since the resource already exists.
